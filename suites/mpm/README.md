# Material Point Method (MPM) Benchmark

## Introduction
Material Point Method (MPM) is widely used in physical simulations. The required 
computations for high-quality scenarios are intensive, and the achievable performance
is critical for real-time applications.
In this benchmark, we compare a Taichi implementation to its ported version in CUDA.
The measurement is based on open-souce implementations. You can find the
original [Taichi implementation
here](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/blob/master/python/taichi/examples/simulation/mpm3d.py)
and the [CUDA implementation here](https://github.com/Aisk1436/mpm3d).

The MPM application consists of four kernels: Reset, Particle to Grid (P2G),
Update Grid, and Grid to Particle (G2P). In CUDA implementation, each of these
is mapped to a CUDA kernel. In Taichi implementation, each of these kernel is 
mapped to an outermost for-loop within a Taichi kernel (the Mega-Kernel).
Instead of explicitly mapping the problem size to each GPU thread as in CUDA
code, 
Taichi automatically parallelizes the outermost for-loops. Consequently, the code
is more concise and easier to read.
Note that the CUDA implementation utilizes Eigen matrix and vector data type to 
benefit from its concise syntax. Both the CUDA and Taichi implementation utilize
L1 cache instead of explicitly control shared memory. 

## Evaluation
We conduct performance evaluation on the following device.

|Device| Nvidia RTX 3080 (10GB)|
|-----|-----------------------|
|FP32 performance| 29700 GFLOPS|
|Memory bandwidth| 760 GB/s|
|L2 cache capacity| 5 MB|
|Driver version| 470.57.02|
|CUDA version| 11.4|

Performance is measured in milliseconds per frame (ms), we run over different
number of particles, for 2- and 3-dimensions, respectively.

## Reproduction Steps

* Pre-requisites
```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade taichi
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
```
If you want to compare with CUDA, make sure you have `nvcc` properly installed.

* Run the benchmark and draw the plots
```shell
python3 plot_benchmark.py
```
